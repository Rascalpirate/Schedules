# This app is intended for managing my targets, todo lists, reminders at any time and checklists for what-at-what-when for developing the self-discipline habits.
# what-at-what-when means what to do at what happens when it's the time of what.
# Note: the machine is more loyal than one's memory.
# Note: process is more important than one's mind at work. More can be spared for innovation.
